Welcome to AngularJS Fundamentals!

You need to have NodeJS installed on your system before you can proceed.

To setup these demos run the following commands:

npm install -g bower (installs Bower)
npm install -g http-server (installs a simple file server)
bower install (Installs all of the front-end dependencies based off of bower.json)
http-server (starts a web server in your terminal. Type Ctrl-C to quit)

Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 and enjoy!


When you get to Demo 5B you will need to setup and run the local back-end server in another terminal window.

Navigate to the server folder and run the following commands:

npm install (installs the back-end dependencies based off of package.json)
node app.js (starts an Express server in your terminal. Type Ctrl-C to quit)


When you get to Unit 10, please see the included readme file for further instructions.
